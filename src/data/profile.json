  "bio": "I help brands make their message land — showing the human side of products and services, and simplifying communication so it actually resonates. My approach is simple: make brand messages feel like a gist, not marketing. Something people want to watch, follow, and engage with. At my core, I'm a storyteller first — a social media manager, content creator, brand campaign lead, scriptwriter, and creator-led partnership collaborator who turns products, places, and ideas into engaging digital narratives that hold attention.",
